# Geosoft GX API Specification Repository

This is the repository used to generate wrapper source code and documentation for the Geosoft Core GX libraries. At its heart the GX API is exposed as a low level C API that is version stable. The API specification files are used to define and document the signature of the API calls. 

Refer to the documentation for more information on using the GX API.
